Attempted:

    Stage 0:

        Got the basic language working reasonably quickly after getting my head around what I was actually doing

    Stage 1:

        This stage took a little longer to properly implement COND grammar as the way I originally tried to do it did not work and had to rewrite a good portion of my parser

    Stage 2:

        I had actually completed most of the new grammar from the previous step and just needed to implement the new nodes and the else statements, which weren't too hard to do

    Stage 3:

        I didn't even attempt this stage as it was getting late and I had to finish up before I went insane.

I tested everything up to stage 2 with a combonation of the Parser2Test file and a program that I will add below. This confirmed that everything worked as it should.

move(8);
turnL;
loop {
   while ( or(eq(numBarrels, 0), lt(add(oppFB, oppLR), add(barrelFB,barrelLR))) ) {
      if (lt(oppFB,0)) { turnAround; }
      else {if (gt(oppFB,0)) { move(add(1, div(oppFB, 2))); }
            else {if (lt(oppLR,0)) { turnL;}
                  else {if (gt(oppLR,0)) { turnR;}
                        else {if (eq(oppLR,0)) { takeFuel; }}}}
   }
}
if ( and(eq(barrelFB, 0),eq(barrelLR, 0))) { takeFuel; }
else {if ( lt(barrelFB, 0) ){ turnAround; }
      else {if ( gt(barrelFB, 0) ) { move(barrelFB); }
            else {if ( lt(barrelLR, 0) ) { turnL; }
                  else { if ( gt(barrelLR, 0) ) { turnR; }}}}}
}
